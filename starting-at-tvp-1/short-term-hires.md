# Short-Term Hires

#### When there is a lateral hire

The risk exposure that the organisation undertakes stays constant and the time afforded to grow reduces for the individual on pro-rated. For there exists a reason why they are more valuable \(and hence hired laterally\), else our hiring has failed.

Hence, fixed salaries become stakes and the higher you start with, the higher risk \(and pressure\) you take. Hence, we recommend you to focus on accurate price instead of a higher starting base for the sake of it, and then grow into your goal income in due course.

Dry run:

Example org has level 1\(autonomy\) salary at 30k and level 2 \(leadership\) at 60k a month. The time exposure designed in the protocol is 6 months for an individual to grow from level 1 to 2. Hence, the risk allocated to the hire is 30k\*6= 180k.

When someone is hired laterally at level 2 at 60k a month, he has 180k/60k= 3months to succeed at level 2.  
  
  


Principles:

1. No compromise on quality. The recruitment parameters will not be relaxed.
   1. Current process: [Jarvis - Recruitment](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yDuT1mSA1cSslxcPj5-uqkg7GYNnTTZfJru9PbwZ4XI/edit#heading=h.az3hdkq48c9x)
   2. Current threshold is: &gt;5 on all A-player attributes
2. Ascend path and Payroll mapping stays the same. Current pay levels may serve as good references, but do not demand adherence. There is no separate capital allocation made for these hires. And their costs come from success payout. Junior partners are recommended to maintain a balance from their previous successes, to create a reserve to enable them to hire at will.
3. Weâ€™ll limit the usage to under 3 months. At the end of 3 months, either the individuals come aboard or move onto other things in life. This is the basis of the view that productivity is a function of motivation, and motivation is a function of alignment. Hence, a higher productive individual is likely to be available in such course.
