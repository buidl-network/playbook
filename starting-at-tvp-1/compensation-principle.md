# Compensation principle

#### Compensation principle

Our goal with salary is that it checks the box of "enough" for folks who are excited about working here \(because of our mission, people and work\) and then fades into the background.

We follow a band based structure corresponding to each ascend level. The idea is to prevent salary from becoming a guessing game. Its simple and straight forward.

Most critical roles \(across all levels\) are designed to have a "success" payout built in and would serve as the method to keep motivation sustained and pumping until you grow into the next level.
