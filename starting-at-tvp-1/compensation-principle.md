# Compensation Principle

Our goal with salary is that it checks the box of "enough" for folks who are excited about working here \(because of our mission, people and work\) and then fades into the background.

We follow a level based structure corresponding to each ascend level. The idea is to prevent salary from becoming a guessing game. It's simple and straight forward.  
  
You earnings here will comprise of:

1. **Base Pay:** This is decided by the level based structure and is a function of your skill level and assessment on the [_ascend path_](https://playbook.thevantageproject.com/evolving-at-tvp/ascend-paths/)_._
2. **Success Pay:** This will be a function of the process you are the part of and is linked to outcomes. 

For most individuals, Success Pay will add 2x to their Base Pay distributed over an annual timeframe.  
  
This eliminates the need for a manager to decide on the value that you add, and instead let your actions do it in a permissionless environment. Thus, putting you in control.

The system is designed to afford a growth of 2x every year.
