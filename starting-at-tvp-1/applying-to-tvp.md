## Applying to TVP

> It doesn't make sense to hire smart people and tell them what to do; we hire smart people so they can tell us what to do.Steve Jobs

We look for [A-players](). We see ourselves as a sports team, always playing to win. And scout and nurture for the next future Messi/Ronaldo/&lt; insert a player that inspires you &gt;.

* We understand that a job search/switch is a strenous process. We want to make it as swift and predictable as possible.
* The process is designed to reach a successful conclusion within 2 weeks. And ever candidate we talk to is given closure. That's the least we think we can do.
* We don't do JDs. Instead you will find us talking about the kind of problems you'd be working on here.

#### 1. Scouting

Our scouts are always on the look out. When something catches their eye that demonstrates that we might be a relevant spot in the universe for you, they will reach out and have a conversation.

#### 2. Establishing relevance

We like truth. The conversation will usually start with why we think you may be a good fit. And encourage you to apply for the role.

#### 3. Evaluation

This is where we assess current strengths and weaknesses in your skill set and cuture fit. This is usually done asynchronousy over emails, to give you ample mindspace to respond \(and not react\).

#### 4. First date

We don't like the word interview. Instead it is an oppurtunity to get to know each other, for the both of us. Please do come prepared with any questions that you may have for us.

This is also when we'll extend a contingent offer, including specifics of the role. This for us both to get on the same page in terms of expectations. And help you make the decision easier.

#### 5. Meet the team

If you are actively considering us it would be wise to meet and work with the team for a day before you commit to a longer term engagement. This is that moment.

#### 6. Design your next 45 days

We would strongly encourage you to spend time to visualize your next 45 days. If you can’t see it, you haven’t thought about your decision with consciousness. Do so now.

Include but not limit to:

* **Your win:** Map out your OKR for day 30. [Deep dive]()
* **1:1-review schedule:** Start with scheduling all 1:1s in advance on your team leader's calendar. [Deep dive]()
* **Self-training:** Account for the time it would take to learn 'how to operate' protocol here. [Deep dive]()

This is the moment of the final offer.

#### Welcome to Day 0

Welcome aboard!
