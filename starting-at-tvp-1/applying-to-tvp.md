![](../.gitbook/assets/rsz_1rsz_1rsz_jarvis.png)

Meet [_Jarvis_](https://playbook.thevantageproject.com/starting-at-tvp/jarvis/): our in-house AI that executes this process. Currently helping our applicant receive decision in under 3 days.

The steps:

1. **Getting to know you \|** Slack ****This is about understanding your journey, your skills and your desires. 
2. **Feeling each others energy \|** Zoom ****Let's get on a 15 minute zoom call. We'll use this time to deep dive into your journey. And also include an additional 15 minutes, for any questions you may have. We encourage you to document them before hand. 
3. **Dry Run \|** Slack  
   ****Commitment requires conviction. This your moment to build that. 

   We'll invite you to work with us on a weekend work sprint and get a glimpse of what it would be like working with our team.  

4. **Gearing-up for Success \|** Zoom ****It is sub-optimal to commit to a journey without an idea of where it leads. We'll help you by setting up a day-45 win for you. And help you get clarity on how you will be able to achieve it. We'd like to see you start on a high note. 
5. **Inviting you onboard \|** Slack We'd love to see you accept and come aboard.

### **First 45 Days**

> Stoploss is a method used in the financial markets to limit loss from a trade that goes wrong, as a method to manage risk.

Day 45 is your stop loss.

We want to see every individual be productive when working here. Sometimes, that will not happen.   
  
Day 45, is when we'll strongly ask you to observe your happiness being here.   
If the answer isn't a resounding yes, you encourage you to walk away. No questions asked.
