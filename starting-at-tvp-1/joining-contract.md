* All payments are categorised as payment for professional services.
* The advantage with this approach is that you only end up paying taxes on half your income. So, if your income is under ₹10 lakhs, your income tax is 0. [Read more](https://cleartax.in/s/easiest-way-to-file-returns-and-save-taxes-for-creative-professionals)
* The downside is that your [TDS](https://cleartax.in/s/what-is-tax-deducted-at-source-tds) goes up. This process is done at our end. The law mandates a 10% TDS deduction on income greater than 30k in a financial year. [Read more](https://cleartax.in/s/section-194j/#Threshold)

* This is advance tax that's paid in Income tax depertment's account under your name, and the IT department adjusts it against your actual tax liability at the end of the year. That is, when you file your IT returns at the end of the year, the department adjusts your actual tax due against the already accrued TDS and returns the balance in your account.



**Demystifying the Dotted Line**

We seek to enable a culture of individual freedom, responsibility and growth. This approach is contrarian to labor law, that seeks to incentivize the delusion of 'permanency' of jobs.   
  
 Hence, we stay clear of it. Instead we \(i.e. you and us\) decide and commit to the terms of our engagement that 'we' choose and sign that into a contract. This applies for everyone in the team.

Here is the contract we use: [CONTRACT TEMPLATE](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11J0nJaAOqBjHGz4J0JK4b4cW-BGTOc31rpAWuJsjomI/edit)

Here is more on why we do so:

* We like to engage with each other as free self-responsible individuals, without a bureaucrat dictating what can and can not be done.
* You should only be here because you want to \(be here\), not because you 'have' to by some law.
* Similarily, it incentivizes us to create a culture that is enticing enough for everyone to stick together.
* The idea of permanancy is untrue. Impermanace is the true nature of the universe. And we respect that. We seek to attract individuals that reject this delusion.
* Do not expect a boss-employee relationship. We are all co-passengers on the same journey, albeit ephemeral \(in the larger scheme of things\).
* PS: This approach also translates into lower taxes for each individual.

Here is what we do instead:

* 11 month contracts with everyone that are set to auto-renew. Includes details of all benefits and perks.
* Playbook is a part of the contract. It is every evolving, hence, you are responsible for keeping in touch with it. Check for \#playbook-changelog channel on slack.
