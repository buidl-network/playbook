# Leaving TVP

## Leaving TVP

Change is the natural course of the universe. We understand that we are not married for life.

Moreover, we want you to be here only until it is your appropriate spot. It is a legitimate possibility that it isn't going to be the case, in a moment future. We want to encourage you to seek that ideal spot for you and want to make that transition without envoking agitation in either you or the org.

#### Let's do it together

Trust us enough to involve us even when the idea of leaving is just a thought. We will run through the process with you together, including offering you vantage on evaluating your considerations, recommending a path ahead and help you with references and connects that would be helpful. Speak with your leader.

#### Interventions

Failure is not an event worthy of firing, lack of alignment is. We will only intervene on your \(not your stated desire's\) behalf, if and when we feel you are not happy here AND not asking the question \(from your self\) whether we are still your ideal spot in the universe.

Your team leader will usually intervene using the phrase "Excuse me, Life is Waiting".

Be self-responsible.

If you are not happy, figure out why. Address it. Itâ€™s not our responsibility to add meaning to your life. Eventhough it is in our interest to do so. We use the tool of affordance, for that's the most we can do.

#### PS: It's not you, it's us

We recognize that our way of work may not be suited for everyone and it may sometimes take a while to dawn. Hence, we offer as much information as early as possible, for you to make an accurate decision. And we continue to create those affordances with multiple checkpoints \(as part of your 1:1s\) along the way. One each at day 45 and month 3.

And if you do reach awareness that we are not your ideal spot, no stress. We will still love you the same and wish to see you succeed in whatever you journey you take forward.
