# Celebrating Goodbyes

There are 3 scenarios for goodbyes to occur:

### 1. You are not happy here

Happiness is a worthy pursuit in itself. Unhappiness kills productivity. You are better off somewhere, where you are happy. We encourage you to take that leap.

#### Routine:

**1. We can do this together**  
Our paths becoming divergent does not have to imply that the love between us has to change. We want to see you happy. Try:

If happiness is still unsolved, then proceed.

**2. Leverage our trust in you**  
We have an extensive network of teams where our word is likely to hold value. Use us for access and leverage. 

 **3. Do accept our parting gift**  
Your Profile here will be archived and be made accessible to you in perpetuatity, to showcase your accomplishments during your journey here.



### 2. You are not ready yet

Sometimes a role may demand higher productivity than where you are at the moment. We will have to say goodbye to you. However, we are likely to be a good fit in due course. 

**1. Feel free to use us**   
Twitter and our blog is the best place to find our thoughts. Our thoughts are our primary leverage.  
  
**2. Our Parting gift**  
An invite to our \#mastering and \#learning channels.  

Its fun working together with you and we look forward to doing so in the future.



### 3. A limit was violated

The occurrence of a violation demonstrates that being here wasn't important enough.

We'll let you go immediately. Bad-faith actions will also attract appropriate punitive action.
