# Realignment Solitude

Long term games with Long term players. We are in life together. We are a team, teams lift each other up.

#### Change 6: Realignment solitude

There are times when people lose motivation and will need help getting back on track. This will require a trend reversal.   


Trend reversals do not occur under pressure. Irrespective of what the hero within/learned bravado may have us believe. 

  
Reversals occur when:

1. Current trend loses its steam
2. Reverse trend picks ups strength

We will create a system to enable both.  
  
  


Process

Realignment solitude will be a period of at-most 45 days with the following steps:

1. Conversation: ![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-dcAN6YoXaG7PFgHkJjhPfX2j2kHmUnDR_eOzuW6vxgQNm3abq7wt_LgIxQGguRd_syAnyY9nMRbGCzk7EEYtqY0v_y_GlU1TDxSUhbb1Pk4GVqdJSTAuZ9Hk-BP5Rv7zRioFOv9) ^From playbook  When dissonance \(opposite of resonance\) is conveyed and not visible it creates less than binary commitment. Hence, it is important for the individual to be able to see the same picture, and all of the available neurons can be called to prep.

  
This can be done through a mindful conversation.  
PS: This should not become a feedback session. For, the individual’s neurons are already loaded and do not need the weight of more opinion. Instead, the objective is to merely see the same picture. The to-dos are visible within.  
  
Dissonance is easy to observe. It reflects in output. And on deeper observation, in your state of happiness.  
  


An individual can observe his resonance by how easily others \(specifically junior partners\) are able to bet on them. An upward trend \(not absolute value\) in responsibility correlates to resonance.

1. Solitude: Atmost 15 days Step 1 is to let the downward trend lose steam by dissipating its energy. The system will do so by realigning the ask from the individual and putting them on a non-critical path.  At this point, failure is expected. Success would be a miracle.  This affords a space of self-observation. Use this space to observe your actions and discover the joy of creation again. Without the pressure of scrutiny of that creation.  
2. Re-alignment: Atmost 30 days This is when the bottom is in, and the uptrend starts. The individual sees a role for themselves and applies their energies to accomplish. Starting small and increasing the quantum with time. The goal is to discover the joy of success again.  The role may be one that already exists within the system, or maybe entirely new and unrelated to our current vector.  

Notes:

1. The period is optional. If the individual does not find it in themselves the desire to try again, we understand. They may leave, no questions asked. 
2. This should become benign in emotion and frequently used.

Thought process: 

1. Risk management: Team’s success is correlated to the individual’s output. It needs to be protected.
2. Creating a possibility of Turn-around: It is \#1 that enables \#2 possible.

We commit to batting for the individual hence when dissonance occurs, we must enable whatever it would need for us to put all our energies behind getting the individual back to being productive.  
  
It would be easier yet foolish to say bye. Foolish, for up till this point we would have already paid a price for the lost output. And saying bye would mean that we lose a potential upside from the learning from failure. This change is a method to assess if the latter occurred.  


Hence, we will not create sensitivity to the risk by pre-empting it, and will instead choose our exposure to risk. Doing the latter helps us back the individual without worrying about doing a disservice to the rest of the team.  
  


Trigger:

1. When devolution occurs i.e. A change of &gt;2 in any one of the attribute scores occurs.
   1. Outside +/- 2 range, as long as above threshold. 
2. At volition of the respective of Junior Partner.
   1. PS: He is responsible for their team’s output.  

When does Realignment Solitude end  
  


1. If the trend reversal occurs and re-alignment is achieved, between day 0 to day 45; the solitude ends.  An easy self-test to see it is to ask within, “Am I ready for higher responsibility?”

  
Whenever you feel fit, healthy and able again; it will be visible. Hence, a lucrative opportunity for a junior partner to expand his team \(and output\). If your assessment is true, you will be picked and assigned a higher responsibility, and back on the main chain.   
  


1. If the trend reversal does not occur by day 45; cooling-off period kicks in.  We’ll spend the next month helping you find your ideal spot and pay you for it.  The thought behind it is that if you are still unhappy, then perhaps we are no longer your ideal spot in the universe. We’ll help you find that spot. We’ll make intros where you need and keep your base pay intact to give you ample time to make the next call. 

Why is solitude important.

When you are down, you will need all your energy and neurons to get back up. Any neurons that are busy worrying about the uncertainty of your place in the team will only increase the probability of failure. Probably making it certain.

The other lens:   


When we are dissonant, we have already lost each other and are only waiting for the breaking point to make it official. Firing is merely a formality and removes the opportunity for growth. Hence, a leading indicator is needed even if its accuracy may be less than binary.  


From the system point of view, we will assume that each individual that we take in is an A-player. Now, when dissonance exists, the system has failed. Not the individual.   


I’d like to assume that I am wrong. The goal is to be less wrong over time.
