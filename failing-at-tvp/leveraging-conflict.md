# Leveraging Conflict

## What do you se ****

### **What is the conflict?**

**Karan: "I am unable to find the strategy for execution of the frontend. Would it be possible to send me a documentation of the strategy you're following for the same?"**

**Akshat: "How do I strategize when I don't have the knowledge?"**

**Sahil: "didn’t we discuss that you start execution based on sample API responses for home page returns"**  


### **What is bothering everybody?**

**Friction in collaboration due to ineffective communication.**

**People are NOT able to communicate what they want and are instead resorting to violence.**  


### **Section for team members:**

**Thoughts to trigger conversation:** 

* **Please answer the questions with truth. Generally at BUIDL the affordance is present throughout but there are some concerns you may want to share privately.** 
  * **A request to share them in the space.** 
    * **Written or shared in the meeting is on your own volition.** 
  * **These are private notes not shared with anyone. You may do so at your volition.**  
* **If you have to think and rephrase answers, think whether having a clear conscience \(a good night sleep\) is better than hypocritical politeness.**  
* **We are building BUIDL together, and we see you as an equal team player.** 

## **Section for Sahil:**

**What are the blockers you are facing that you may need help with?** 

**Thoughts to trigger conversation:** 

**These might be blockers that have had a consistent trend and you aren’t able to fix them.**   
  
  
  


**At this point in time, how would you evaluate yourself on A player attributes?** 

**Thoughts to trigger conversation:**

* **To refresh your memory of what each attribute means in action, please read/re-read:** [**A player attributes**](https://www.thevantageproject.com/playbook/#aplayer) **section of the playbook.** 
* **Be aware of** [**imposter syndrome**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome)**.** 

| **Attributes** | **Previous review scores \(previously collaborative scores arrived at in 1:1\)** | **Current review scores \(self\)**  | **Am I growing? \(delta\)** | **Collaborative Scores \(arrived at in 1:1\)** |

**Arrive at the answer to "How do I go about making it more efficient for people to work with me"?**

**Thoughts to trigger conversation:**

* **On the answer’s upside: 'Arrive' occurs through gathering feedback from people you interact with. Each person can give you a lot of data points for you to introspect on. This is very useful to limit** [**self-serving bias**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-serving_bias)**.**  
* **Capping downside in your thought process: Be aware of** [**imposter syndrome**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome)**.** 

**What is your feedback for the team?** 

**For Karan:**

* **Delay on design**
* **Lack of communication**

**Blockers with the person faced by the team:**

* **Not having complete vantage on the system and defaulting to trust to get things done**
  * * **As a symptom, allowing things to be executed without a mutually agreed upon strategy for the same**

**Thoughts to trigger conversation:**

* **What can the team do to further improve themselves? Are there blockers in your collaboration?** 
* **Things that you have noticed that you wanted to give them advice on but couldn't.**  
* **No system level sync in the team**
  * **Individuals have to resort to always feeling the need to ask the other individual of where they are at and when the dependency will get to be closed.** 
  * **No daily updates across the board creates vacuum.** 
    * **Individuals writing daily logs in their own scope - doesn’t help the team across the board.**  
  * **Sahil and Karan** 
    * **Todo’s at your end - solve.**   
* **Feeling of being hired early:** 
  * **Since nothing has been concretely done in terms of execution.**  
  * **Conclusion from Akshat: that he thinks with the above loose systems of daily syncup + getting vantage of the ecosystem - this feeling can be removed.**

**\[Karan’s thought’s\]**

**Lack of mindfulness:**

**“Don’t make the game about what you want to do. Instead, make it about what is appropriate. Play to win the game, not make the avatar your identity. Fight for truth, not ego.” -** [**TVP Playbook**](https://www.thevantageproject.com/playbook/#aplayer)

**Ownership suffers due to lack of mindfulness - where the problem is not seen as what is appropriate, but instead as "what I want to do".**  
  


**Prastut’s Thoughts**

**Lack of empathy:**

**Advice: move to the next stage by moving out of the imperial mindset.**   
  


**Blockers that you have faced personally with the direct report:**

**Thoughts to trigger conversation:**

* **Think about times you did a bad job at leading.**
* **Think about times when you made decisions by position rather than vantage.**  
  * **It’s perfectly reasonable to overrule a junior person who is closer to the metal on something, but if you do so, you need to be responsible for understanding all of the inputs into that decision.**
  * **Recognize though that you burn a certain amount of social capital each time you overrule a more junior person purely through position. If you do this over and over, instead of explaining the underlying why and shifting to a vantage-based decision, you will eventually burn your best people out.**
* **Think about times you did a bad job at leading.**
  * **Not enough data points**
* **Think about times when you made decisions by position rather than vantage.** 
  * **None**

## **How will we solve the conflict? \(What’s Next?\)**

  
**Operation Level problem:** 

1. **Reducing vacuum everyday between team so that everybody is on the same page.** 
   1. **\[Karan\] implement the new protocol**
      1. **Protocol is above.** 

**Design Dept:** 

1. **Karan &lt;-&gt; Prastut finalize design.** 
   1. **Low-fi is ready**
   2. **Hi-fi needs to be finalized.** 

**Tech Dept:** 

1. **Crude simulation of the new stack \(backend + frontend\) working in tandem.** 
   1. **These pipes are working properly:** 
      1. **Polkadot -&gt; Backend**
      2. **Backend &lt;-&gt; DB**
      3. **Frontend &lt;-&gt; Backend**   
   2. **Yieldscan-test.surge.sh**
      1. **Nominator table**  
2. **Frontend:** 
   1. **Akshat**
      1. **Staking inside Polkadot** 
         1. [**https://github.com/buidl-labs/YieldScan/blob/develop/src/components/Testing/index.js**](https://github.com/buidl-labs/YieldScan/blob/develop/src/components/Testing/index.js)
         2. **Official documented:** 
            1. [**Extension-dapp**](https://github.com/polkadot-js/extension/tree/master/packages/extension-dapp)
      2. **Full process is documented here:** 
         1. [**BUIDL Labs - YieldScan - Pre-spec**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZSi83cQQNg2Br6UMT64mTM5SG0PlGh_cu3MCbNKvC5g/edit#bookmark=id.kdf1saxzbx3u)
3. 1. 1. **Mock data** 
         1. **Non Risk and risk based reward calculation -&gt;** 
            1. **UI -&gt; homepage and rewards calculator**  
4. **Backend:** 
   1. **Sahil:** 
      1. **New Backend - roughly by 13th** 
      2. **Mock data api - by 10th EoD**

**Todos:**

* **No system level sync in the team**
  * **Solve - Karan and Sahil**  
* **Every working day:** 
  * **Schedule this:** 
  * **There is a calendar invite that has already been created with a recurring Zoom call link.** 
  * **The meeting happens by pull not by push:** 
    * **What I mean by this is:** 
      * **On the thread of the notification \(which I guess can come 20 mins before\).** 
        * **People can write a doubt that they are facing** 
          * **And cc the other person who they feel that has the best possible answer to it.** 
    * **This will only work:** 
      * **When all of the team members see the logic behind it -&gt; which is reducing vacuum in the team on small questions/issues.** 
      * **And people keep their time between 6 - 7PM \(the team can decide their own time\) free. There is no obligation to do anything in that time.**  
      * **The vision is “Chai pe charcha”** 

**Principle to design it for.**  


#### **Change 13: Introducing Unblocking Time**

  
**The attempt is to create daily whitespaces within each project team, for them to be able to huddle together and remove roadblocks.  
  
Suggested method:**

1. **6-7PM slot kept available everyday.**
   1. **Project leader may setup a slack reminder for the channel to invite each member to reach out wherever they get stuck.**
2. **If and when individuals need facetime of other members, without worrying about disturbing their schedule.** 
   1. **They may respond to the slack reminder message with: I am stuck here and I would like to pull in X**
      1. **X can be any other individual in the team.**
   2. **This can occur any time during the day.** 
3. **At 6pm everyone whose mind space was solicited \(through being cc’ed\) joins to the zoom link mentioned in the reminder.**

  
**Principles:**

1. **Keeping time available is the default ask, not booked.**
   1. **Some \(or most times\) the unblocking slot will go unused.**
2. **Join the call when invited and drop off whenever you feel appropriate.**
3. **Keep them short, but light. Play without the weight of appropriate behaviour.**   

**Why this change**

**Working remote != work alone. We are still a team and there are efficiencies available to be unlocked, when facetime is used appropriately.  
  
A version of this has been experimented with each time and**
