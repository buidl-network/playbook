# Celebrating Goodbyes

There are 3 scenarios for goodbyes to occur:

### 1. You are not happy here

Happiness is a worthy pursuit in itself. Unhappiness kills productivity. You are better off somewhere, where you are happy. We encourage you to take that leap.

Here is what you may do:

1. **Let's do this together** Our paths becoming divergent does not have to imply that the love between us has to change. We want to see you happy.  Try: [Realignment Solitude](https://playbook.thevantageproject.com/failing/realignment-solitude)  If unhappiness still exists, then continue to the next step. 
2. **Leverage our trust in you** Start looking for new oppurtunities. We have an extensive network of teams where our word is likely to hold value. Use us for access and leverage. 
3. **Do accept our parting gift** Your Profile here will be archived and be made accessible to you in perpetuity, as a chronicle of your accomplishments.

### 

### 2. We are not ready for you, yet. 

What this means is that we don't know how to produce the most value out of you, yet.   
For personal growth, view the above status from a position of self-responsibility.

Sometimes a role may not be scoped out properly, and hence the system needs to take a journey on its own time to arrive at the appropriate role. We apologize for the inconvenience and hope you give us a chance when we are likely to be a good fit in due course.

1. **Leverage our trust in you**  
   Start looking for new opportunities. We have an extensive network of teams where our word is likely to hold value. Use us for access and leverage.

  

2. **Our Parting gift** An invite to be a [guest co-passenger](https://playbook.thevantageproject.com/starting/guest-co-passengers).  It's fun working together and we look forward to doing so in the future.

### 

### 3. A limit was violated

The occurrence of a violation demonstrates that being here wasn't important enough.

We'll let you go immediately. Actions done in bad-faith will also attract appropriate punitive action.
