# Operating at TVP

### Operating at TVP

All structures discussed here are support structures to help you ascend.

1. The tool of choice \(used here\) is affordance.
2. You will not be penalized for non-compliance. Or rewarded for compliance.
3. You will need them to perform. Do it for yourself. And no one else.

Tools you will need to get ready to start:[ETA culture Bet on yourself and your vantage. Improve with time.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZGa6diesOmx-jSBjm0uj8j4oN75gYqux85qA7DJOm68/edit)[Daily logs We highly recommend a habit of maintaining daily logs i.e. a simple list of what you did today and what you are going to do tomorrow.This is for your own use to observe yourself. Think of it like your own personal version history.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10pkMYbKmBWRIVFkC3nGb7ViY2216ysxI8KLiwEUm7OY/edit)[OKR Framework Helps document everyone's bet on what they think they will achieve in the next month.The excercise helps every individual think through their path ahead and offer coherence with everyone else.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XzzTeBf2aKgIWbOfb4LxCpV8MGDM9KhQw2WlvxDHIls/edit)[Feedback mechanism What isn't tracked, doesn't get improved.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wH0KcFdXLtURERe_TAtYp2vDl49khHGQrG3weL0eog8/edit)

Tools we encourage:

[Brain.fm](https://www.brain.fm/): Functional music to improve focus.

[Vipassana:](https://www.vridhamma.org/discourses/How-to-Discipline-the-Mind) Mindful equanimous meditation. Discover the principle behind it [here](https://www.vipassana.com/meditation/mindfulness_in_plain_english_9.php)

Operational things:

**Getting Paid**

All staff payments are made by the 5th of the month. We also follow another payment cycle around the 20th of the month, for vendor payments.

**Reimbursements**

We follow a no-bureaucracy policy. And instead have focused on fostering meritocracy i.e. correlating higher productivity to a higher payout for you. And hence, everything that increases your productivity funds its self. Buy for yourself, whatever makes you better.

Any non-personal spend can be suggested on the \#office channel on slack.
