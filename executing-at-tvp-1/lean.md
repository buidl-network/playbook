# Critical Constraint

#### Critical path is the shortest path

In the car assembly line, the maximum rate of production is = the lowest common rate of the all components. ONLY the lowest common rate.

Hence, the input car part that is the slowest \(most lagging\) is what the final assembly out is going to be. All focus must always be to increase rate of production only that step.

In chemistry there exists a similar concept: Rate determining step.

**Vantage:** Always focus on improving the rate determining step. Only. Until it isnâ€™t one anymore. Then move the one that is the new rate determining step.
