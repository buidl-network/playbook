# Critical Constraint

### The Rate Limiting Step

In the car assembly line, the maximum rate of production is = the lowest common rate of the all components. ONLY the lowest common rate.

Hence, the input car part that is the slowest \(most lagging\) is what the final assembly out is going to be. All focus must always be to increase rate of production only that step.

In chemistry, there exists a similar concept: Rate Determining Step.

### Solve only 1 problem, the critical problem; at a time

See activity in terms of speed. Find the critical constraint that is reducing rate of progress. 

Only solve that, until it isn't the critical constraint anymore. Then move to the new one.

### Critical path is the shortest path

A string of critical problems solved leading to output is the critical path. It is the most efficient.
