# Purpose Driven Action

### All motion is not Progress

It's difficult to see the difference in the middle of an activity. The problem lies in our belief system.

Reference [_Start with Answer first \| Effective Communication_](https://playbook.thevantageproject.com/operating-at-tvp/effective-communication)_._

We are taught to start writing what we know, instead of observing the validity of the question.

### Purpose-First   __

When starting to execute, take a pause. Start with a visual of what is that you want to occur. Then, backpropagate to visualizing the set of activities that will reckon 

Let that view be persistent during all that you do henceforth, until output is achieved. 

In this state, activity isn't the destination in itself, but a mere run-time requirement.

### Solving a problem

> Start with a visual of what is that you want to occur.

What you want to occur, is a User Problem being solved. From this point on, you empower the user to do, something they wanted to do before but wasn't able to. Feel the responsibility. And let that be your guiding light.

 

### Process Output to Business Outcome

{% hint style="info" %}
This section is specifically for Problem See-er path.
{% endhint %}

Not all problems are equal. The problem a Problem See-er solves is Business Growth. 

You can't push growth; you can only remove rate-limiting bottlenecks to.growth. Hence, identifying the right hurdles to unblock is the critical constraint.

Here are the 4 major categories:

1. **Speed** Time to Output
2. **Cost** Speed + Effort of iterations/re-doings.
3. **Quality** Value of output
4. **Control** Configutability of output

Each problem when solved is going to impact one of these areas. Focus on the one which has the most value unlocking potential. Measure value in direct $ terms.

You may find that the most efficient strategy is to attempt them in the same order.
