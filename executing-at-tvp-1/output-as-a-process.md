# Output as a Process

### Outcomes are occurrences, that occur as a result of a process.

Think of a production line that manufactures cars \(for visual\). The output is a completely built car with an assembly line assembling different parts.

Once the car is done, its characteristics and hence, scope isn’t in your control. The only place where you’d be able to impact change is in the process before it.

This POV is similar to systems thinking. The latter helps in analysis and helps arrive at "why", the former is forward looking and helps arrive at "how to".

**Vantage:** Whenever trying to understand how an outcome will be achieved, focus on seeing the process behind its current state \(if it’s an optimization strategy\) or seeing the process behind a similar or correlated outcome \(if it’s an innovation strategy\). In that vantage, you should be able to see the variables of the process and hence, its lever. You are now in control.
