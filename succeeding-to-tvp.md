# Succeeding to TVP

## How to succeed at TVP

Affordance, not entitlement.

Every individual's progress here occurs when \(because\) they have grown so much that it becomes stupid to not give them more responsibility. And for no other reason.

Focus all your energies on improving your competence. Don't bother with signalling effort.

Here is how individuals ascend at TVP:

#### Level 1: Autonomy \| Day 45

Are you able to extract peak performance from yourself?

Refer to the [A-player framework](https://www.thevantageproject.com/playbook#aplayer). A minimum score of 8 \(out of 10\) on each of the 5 attributes is needed to graduate. And for that to occur, you may start acting on it from day 0.

#### Level 2: Leadership \| Day 180

Are you able to extract peak performance from others?

Leadership is a state of mind. We value the state of mind, not the identity of a being a "leader".

Graduating to level 2 requires a minimum score of 8 \(out of 10\) on all attributes of being an A-leader + a successful outcome \(that you owned\) as an A-leader before Day 180.

What does it mean to be an A-leader:

All teams start from the bottom most level, for only individuals have existed before this. Their combination as a cohesive unit aka team is a new, ever evolving and always unique \(in its shape\) construct that needs to be birthed. And then transitioned to peak performance. It takes leadership to get that to occur.

And that requires channeling the common energy of the group to conquer the following issues in order:

The only tools at a leaders disposal are empathy \(not sympathy\), affordance and inspiration. For the constraints of each individual and the collective unit become your constraints. You can't pretend they don't exist and yet, expect an outcome.

What makes a A-leader:

1. Self-transforming mind

You are no longer held prisoner by your own identity. Your identity \(and role\) is constantly re-created basis what is appropriate for the team's win at the moment. And hence, can hold multiple thoughts and ideologies at once.

Leadership is about serving others, without sacrificing yourself.

2. Self-responsible

If you are angry or agitated, it's not 'their' fault. If your strategy failed, it's not because &lt; insert a random external event &gt;. The buck starts and stops at you.

3. Self-trainable

Geniunelly willing to learn from others. Universe is always trying to show you the path, be listening. Listen to others and be able to arrive at what is a win-win for each situation.

4. Thinks in systems

 "This is happening because the incentives are set up that way". Most effecient incentives are rarely monetary in nature. Spend time to understand why humans do what they do. Recommended read: The Theory of Moral Sentiments by Adam Smith.

Highly recommended watch: [How to operate \| Keith Rabois](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fQHLK1aIBs)

* A leader would focus on maxing out team productivity. Including but not limited to guiding their team towards implementing the operating principles \("Operating at TVP"\) in their lives.
* The path from \(including\) this level onwards is non-trivial. It's fine, take your time. You have time from day 45 to 180 to learn, fail, relearn and succeed.
* Qualifying for this level 2x's the base salary.

#### Level 3: Junior Partner \| Day 360

Are you able to lead and be responsible for \(i.e. own\) a business unit?

* You are responsible for the business case and success, of a part of the business. You have time from day 180 to 360 to learn, fail, relearn and succeed.
* Qualifying for this level 2x's the base salary with the incremental payout being in liquid tokenized stocks.
* A junior partner would focus on strategy for the quarter ahead.
* A 10x win here is needed to graduate.

#### Level 4: Senior Partner \| Day 720

Are you able to lead and be responsible for \(i.e. own\) a business?

* You are responsible for the success of a business. You have time from day 360 to 720 to learn, fail, relearn and succeed.
* You are the conscious keeper of the organisation.
* Qualifying for this level 2x's the base salary again with the incremental payout being in liquid tokenized stocks.
* A senior partner would focus on strategy 4 quarters ahead.

#### How to take on an entreprenurial journey

Every business is designed to constantly explore new oppurtunities in their space of operations. They do so through experiments to validate new business oppurtunities i.e. 0 to 1 phase of the business. Each experiment is led by a Senior partner with a junior partner and an engineer. If and when an experiments succeeds, it is turned into business under TVP and scaled from 1 to 100. You can find yourself a place in that team.

#### When there is a lateral hire

The risk exposure that the organisation undertakes stays constant and the time afforded to grow reduces for the individual on pro-rated. For there exists a reason why they are more valuable \(and hence hired laterally\), else our hiring has failed.

Hence, fixed salaries become stakes and the higher you start with, the higher risk \(and pressure\) you take. Hence, we recommend you to focus on accurate price instead of a higher starting base for the sake of it, and then grow into your goal income in due course.

Dry run:

Example org has level 1\(autonomy\) salary at 30k and level 2 \(leadership\) at 60k a month. The time exposure designed in the protocol is 6 months for an individual to grow from level 1 to 2. Hence, the risk allocated to the hire is 30k\*6= 180k.

When someone is hired laterally at level 2 at 60k a month, he has 180k/60k= 3months to succeed at level 2.

#### Compensation principle

Our goal with salary is that it checks the box of "enough" for folks who are excited about working here \(because of our mission, people and work\) and then fades into the background.

We follow a band based structure corresponding to each ascend level. The idea is to prevent salary from becoming a guessing game. Its simple and straight forward.

Most critical roles \(across all levels\) are designed to have a "success" payout built in and would serve as the method to keep motivation sustained and pumping until you grow into the next level.

#### How are 1:1 reviews done

By your team leader and as per the regular schedule. Hence, choose who you work with, based on whose leadership inspires you and where you are most likely to thrive. [Deep dive]()
