# Value System

First principles of our culture:

#### Trust

**Consistency:** Unpredictability can not be trusted and only fuels doubt. We strive towards a principle based decision making. Playbook is an attempt in that direction.

**Reciprocity:** If performance and reward do not share a direct correlation and/or need a subjective opinion based evaluation, then it isnâ€™t performance that is served.

#### Care

We value ourselves enough to care where and how we spend our time. We look for people that have an insatiable appetite for self-growth and are not okay with existing.

We will always only take limited period bets on people and every moment from that point on will only be to help the individual succeed.

#### Growth

Motion is not progress. Progress is non-trivial.

Our primary intent is to enable an environment condusive to personal growth. You will find traces of this state of mind, all over the playbook.

#### Impact

We perform better when we feel a part of something bigger than ourselves. We seek to offer that feeling to everybody.
