# Limits of Engagement

### Equal Opportunity

We are a meritocratic culture. Your place here is based on the value that you add, not where you come from or your current identity.

This also means no special privileges/considerations. We see you for you; sans the politics. 

### Consent

No one owes you anything. Engage with respect and empathy.   
Respect is an outcome of Consent. Consent needs to be explicit. 

### Truth

You must not lie, hide or conceal truth anytime. That includes honesty towards yourself and towards others. Irrespective of however hard the truth may be.

### Non-Violence

You may not bring your agitations when dealing with others. What offends you is your responsibility; address it.

### Privacy

We embrace a culture of openess, with consent.   
  
Whenever sharing information with the outside world, ask for consent from a Partner before sharing any:  
1. Financial  
2. Strategic  
3. Personal  
information of the company or its individuals.  
  
You will be assigned a company email account. Use that for creating all other work related accounts. No personal accounts to ever be used for work purposes. All such accounts and other work related properties created during employment are company property and not private.
