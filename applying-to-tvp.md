> It doesn't make sense to hire smart people and tell them what to do; we hire smart people so they can tell us what to do.Steve Jobs

We look for [A-players](). We see ourselves as a sports team, always playing to win. And scout and nurture for the next future Messi/Ronaldo/&lt; insert a player that inspires you &gt;.

* We understand that a job search/switch is a strenous process. We want to make it as swift and predictable as possible.
* The process is designed to reach a successful conclusion within 2 weeks. And ever candidate we talk to is given closure. That's the least we think we can do.
* We don't do JDs. Instead you will find us talking about the kind of problems you'd be working on here.

#### 1. Scouting

Our scouts are always on the look out. When something catches their eye that demonstrates that we might be a relevant spot in the universe for you, they will reach out and have a conversation.

#### 2. Establishing relevance

We like truth. The conversation will usually start with why we think you may be a good fit. And encourage you to apply for the role.

#### 3. Evaluation

This is where we assess current strengths and weaknesses in your skill set and cuture fit. This is usually done asynchronousy over emails, to give you ample mindspace to respond \(and not react\).

#### 4. First date

We don't like the word interview. Instead it is an oppurtunity to get to know each other, for the both of us. Please do come prepared with any questions that you may have for us.

This is also when we'll extend a contingent offer, including specifics of the role. This for us both to get on the same page in terms of expectations. And help you make the decision easier.

#### 5. Meet the team

If you are actively considering us it would be wise to meet and work with the team for a day before you commit to a longer term engagement. This is that moment.

#### 6. Design your next 45 days

We would strongly encourage you to spend time to visualize your next 45 days. If you can’t see it, you haven’t thought about your decision with consciousness. Do so now.

Include but not limit to:

* **Your win:** Map out your OKR for day 30. [Deep dive]()
* **1:1-review schedule:** Start with scheduling all 1:1s in advance on your team leader's calendar. [Deep dive]()
* **Self-training:** Account for the time it would take to learn 'how to operate' protocol here. [Deep dive]()

This is the moment of the final offer.

#### Welcome to Day 0

Welcome aboard!

### Demystifying the Dotted Line

We seek to enable a culture of individual freedom, responsibility and growth. This approach is contrarian to labor law, that seeks to incentivize 'permanency' of jobs \(over self-responsibility\). Hence, we stay clear of it. Instead we \(i.e. you and us\) decide and commit to the terms of our engagement that 'we' choose and sign that into a contract. This applies for everyone in the team.

Here is the contract we use: [Contract Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11J0nJaAOqBjHGz4J0JK4b4cW-BGTOc31rpAWuJsjomI/edit)

Here is more on why we do so:

* We like to engage with each other as free self-responsible individuals, without a bureaucrat dictating what can and can not be done.
* You should only be here because you want to \(be here\), not because you 'have' to by some law.
* Similarily, it incentivizes us to create a culture that is enticing enough for everyone to stick together.
* The idea of permanancy is untrue. Impermanace is the true nature of the universe. And we respect that. We seek to attract individuals that reject this delusion.
* Do not expect a boss-employee relationship. We are all co-passengers on the same journey, albeit ephemeral \(in the larger scheme of things\).
* PS: This approach also translates into lower taxes for each individual.

Here is what we do instead:

* 11 month contracts with everyone that are set to auto-renew. Includes details of all benefits and perks.
* Playbook is a part of the contract. It is every evolving, hence, you are responsible for keeping in touch with it. Check for \#playbook-changelog channel on slack.

Taxes:

* All payments are categorised as payment for professional services.
* The advantage with this approach is that you only end up paying taxes on half your income. So, if your income is under ₹10 lakhs, your income tax is 0. [Read more](https://cleartax.in/s/easiest-way-to-file-returns-and-save-taxes-for-creative-professionals)
* The downside is that your [TDS](https://cleartax.in/s/what-is-tax-deducted-at-source-tds) goes up. This process is done at our end. The law mandates a 10% TDS deduction on income greater than 30k in a financial year. [Read more](https://cleartax.in/s/section-194j/#Threshold)
* This is advance tax that's paid in Income tax depertment's account under your name, and the IT department adjusts it against your actual tax liability at the end of the year. That is, when you file your IT returns at the end of the year, the department adjusts your actual tax due against the already accrued TDS and returns the balance in your account.
