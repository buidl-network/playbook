# Celebrating Goodbyes

There are 3 scenarios for goodbyes to occur:

## 1. You are not happy here

Happiness is a worthy pursuit in itself. Unhappiness kills productivity. You are better off somewhere, where you are happy. We encourage you to take that leap.

### Here is the process:

**1. We can do this together**  
Our paths becoming divergent does not have to imply that the love between us has to change. We want to see you happy. Try:

If unhappiness still exists, then continue.

**2. Leverage our trust in you**  
Start looking for new oppurtunities. We have an extensive network of teams where our word is likely to hold value. Use us for access and leverage.

**3. Do accept our parting gift**  
Your Profile here will be archived and be made accessible to you in perpetuity, as a chronicle of your accomplishments.

## 2. You are not \(production\) ready yet

Sometimes a role may demand higher productivity than where you are, at the moment. We are likely to be a good fit in due course. But are not, yet.

**1. Feel free to use us**  
Twitter and our blog is the best place to find our thoughts. Our thoughts are our primary leverage.

**2. Our Parting gift**  
An invite to our \#mastering and \#learning channels.

It's fun working together with you and we look forward to doing so in the future.

## 3. A limit was violated

The occurrence of a violation demonstrates that being here wasn't important enough.

We'll let you go immediately. Actions done in bad-faith will also attract appropriate punitive action.
