# Celebrating Goodbyes

There are 3 scenarios for goodbyes to occur:

### 1. You are not happy here

Happiness is a worthy pursuit in itself. Unhappiness kills productivity. You are better off somewhere, where you are happy. We encourage you to take that leap.

Here is what you may do:

1. **Let's do this together** Our paths becoming divergent does not have to imply that the love between us has to change. We want to see you happy.  Try: [Realignment Solitude](https://playbook.thevantageproject.com/failing/realignment-solitude)  If unhappiness still exists, then continue to the next step. 
2. **Leverage our trust in you** Start looking for new oppurtunities. We have an extensive network of teams where our word is likely to hold value. Use us for access and leverage. 
3. **Do accept our parting gift** Your Profile here will be archived and be made accessible to you in perpetuity, as a chronicle of your accomplishments.

### 

### 2. You are not \(production\) ready yet

Sometimes a role may demand higher productivity than where you are, at the moment. We are likely to be a good fit in due course. But are not, yet.

1. **Feel free to use us** Twitter and our blog is the best place to find our thoughts. Our thoughts are our primary leverage. 
2. **Our Parting gift** An invite to be a [guest co-passenger](https://playbook.thevantageproject.com/starting/guest-co-passengers).  It's fun working together with you and we look forward to doing so in the future.

### 

### 3. A limit was violated

The occurrence of a violation demonstrates that being here wasn't important enough.

We'll let you go immediately. Actions done in bad-faith will also attract appropriate punitive action.
