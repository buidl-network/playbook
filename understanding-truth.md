# Understanding Truth

## Integrity

Are you really living "your" life, or merely executing your learned behaviours \(pre-dispositions\)?

What is you \(i.e. your truth\) cannot be acquired, it is already within. What you need to get to it, is to drop the ego. All fears, insecurities, delusions, hope i.e. all expectations from the universe to behave at your whim. For perhaps, these are merely attributes of the identity of the person that you think you are in your head. In reality, you are limitless.

Integrity != Honesty

Integrity == Your truth in this moment

#### Your

You are not your fear, insecurities; neither are you your hopes and delusions. You are what remains sans them.

Choose your consciousness \(self\) and not the blindness of your predispositions.

#### Truth

To see reality as is, not as you want it to be.

With that perspective, everything external stops being good or bad; it just is. A mere data point. And that frees the mind to focus on appropriate action, instead of indulging in reaction.

#### In the moment

The past exists only within your memory, the future is confined to your dreams. The only place truth can exist in is in this moment.

Have the ability to be whatever you choose to be in this moment, irrespective of whatever the moment last was.

### Integrity in action

> Don't confuse what you wish were true with what is really true.Ray Dalio

To do \(choose\) what is appropriate for the moment, not what you "want" to be appropriate instead.

For that "want" is perhaps inaccurate until it is an awareness i.e. it is not a reaction but a response. An example of commonly accepted yet inaccurate "want" is when at the time of committing to deliver an outcome, the choice of doing your best is made.

> Ask: Can you deliver X outcome by Y time?  
>  Response: I will do my best

Now, they may appear the same at the moment; but that can't be farther from the truth. The former is about the outcome, and the latter all about the ego.

Instead, the true version of the moment may be spent finding the path to victory, not indulging in a path that is known to be not. The latter is only an attempt to satiate the desire to appear congruent.

Drop the ego and salvate with service.

#### What would be the truth of this moment?

In this moment:

My truth \(as the voice\), is to mellow this thought enough to be accessible to the largest size of market that TVP needs.

Your truth \(as the listener\) may be to be here with your binary mindspace. Conscious. For that is a precursor for any self-growth to occur.

Spend time living the words here, not merely reading them.

The playbook shall strive for affording its ease, by reducing content overload and focusing on just what you may need to perform.

### Why is integrity the chosen motivator?

TLDR: For it's the reality, of why individuals do what they do.

Long form: For nothing else comes close to the kind of drive that it generates. It = your truth. There is no global truth, there is only subjective truth. Anything that an individual "desire"s and in due course "becomes", occurs. The only time it doesn't, is when the desire is not "true" enough. For you can't intellectualize your truth, you can't convince yourself of it, neither can you borrow it from externalities \(i.e. morality\). Your truth may only be discovered; within. And we are all, at best tending towards our \(true\) "self"s, albiet at different levels of efficiency.

Be here, only when we are your truth.
