# Understanding Truth

### Truth

Your peace cannot be acquired through external inquiry, it is already within. 

It exists in the symphony that is a life lived for its own truth.   
Not a life that dances to the tunes of fear/insecurities or delusions/hope.  
The latter is an entitlement filled state of existence, that desires the universe to behave at its whim. This is ego.

Only free men create value. Ego is your chains, and truth your freedom. 

Ego is \(attachment to\) the identity that one thinks they are.   
In reality, there is only flow.  


### Integrity

Integrity != Honesty

Integrity = Your Truth in this moment  


**Your**  
There is no global objective truth. There are only subjective realities.  
  
Anything that isn't self-discovered, is someone else's truth. It may or may not be yours.   


**Truth**  
Absolute honesty practiced within. Mind, intent and action. 

\*\*\*\*

**In the moment**  
The past exists only in your memory, the future in imagination. Only this moment is the reality.

The ability to exist in the moment, without the baggage of the past or the future; is a superpower. Now, you can 'choose' and be whoever you want to be, including being limitless.

### 

Drop the ego and salvate with service.

### Truth-Seeking 

> "Truth-seeking is hard and often painful, but it is what separates self-belief from self-delusion"  -Sam Altman

Observe your life in third person, and why you do what you do. If you are merely executing learned behaviours, where are you alive?  
  
****To be able to observe the reality as is, and not as you want it to be; is a superpower. 

With that perspective, everything external stops being good or bad; it just is. A mere data point. And that frees your neurons to focus on appropriate action, instead of living life triggered.
