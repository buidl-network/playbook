# Ascend Paths

#### Change 7: Evolution goals and OKRs

1. Attempting for n+1 ascend level i.e. evolution is not the default. It is a choice. You may take it whenever you feel ready. 
2. You may do so by telling your junior partner, so that they can optimize for your learning curve and create space for whenever you’d need help. 
   1. In due course, you’d be able to notify this by adding a slack badge. \#jarvis
3. The ideal time to do so is during the start of the quarter and include it in your OKRs

Enabling backtrack

When evolution goals feels weighty, you are also free to let go and settle for n ascend level.   


In due course you’d be able to just do so by removing the badge from your slack profile.  


Affordance, not entitlement.

Every individual's progress here occurs when \(because\) they have grown so much that it becomes stupid to not give them more responsibility. And for no other reason.

Focus all your energies on improving your competence. Don't bother with signalling effort.

Here is how individuals ascend at TVP:

#### Level 1: Autonomy \| Day 45

Are you able to extract peak performance from yourself?

Refer to the [A-player framework](https://www.thevantageproject.com/playbook#aplayer). A minimum score of 8 \(out of 10\) on each of the 5 attributes is needed to graduate. And for that to occur, you may start acting on it from day 0.

#### Level 2: Leadership \| Day 180

Are you able to extract peak performance from others?

Leadership is a state of mind. We value the state of mind, not the identity of a being a "leader".

Graduating to level 2 requires a minimum score of 8 \(out of 10\) on all attributes of being an A-leader + a successful outcome \(that you owned\) as an A-leader before Day 180.

What does it mean to be an A-leader:

All teams start from the bottom most level, for only individuals have existed before this. Their combination as a cohesive unit aka team is a new, ever evolving and always unique \(in its shape\) construct that needs to be birthed. And then transitioned to peak performance. It takes leadership to get that to occur.

And that requires channeling the common energy of the group to conquer the following issues in order:

The only tools at a leaders disposal are empathy \(not sympathy\), affordance and inspiration. For the constraints of each individual and the collective unit become your constraints. You can't pretend they don't exist and yet, expect an outcome.

What makes a A-leader:

1. Self-transforming mind

You are no longer held prisoner by your own identity. Your identity \(and role\) is constantly re-created basis what is appropriate for the team's win at the moment. And hence, can hold multiple thoughts and ideologies at once.

Leadership is about serving others, without sacrificing yourself.

2. Self-responsible

If you are angry or agitated, it's not 'their' fault. If your strategy failed, it's not because &lt; insert a random external event &gt;. The buck starts and stops at you.

3. Self-trainable

Geniunelly willing to learn from others. Universe is always trying to show you the path, be listening. Listen to others and be able to arrive at what is a win-win for each situation.

4. Thinks in systems

 "This is happening because the incentives are set up that way". Most effecient incentives are rarely monetary in nature. Spend time to understand why humans do what they do. Recommended read: The Theory of Moral Sentiments by Adam Smith.

Highly recommended watch: [How to operate \| Keith Rabois](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fQHLK1aIBs)

* A leader would focus on maxing out team productivity. Including but not limited to guiding their team towards implementing the operating principles \("Operating at TVP"\) in their lives.
* The path from \(including\) this level onwards is non-trivial. It's fine, take your time. You have time from day 45 to 180 to learn, fail, relearn and succeed.
* Qualifying for this level 2x's the base salary.

#### Level 3: Junior Partner \| Day 360

Are you able to lead and be responsible for \(i.e. own\) a business unit?

* You are responsible for the business case and success, of a part of the business. You have time from day 180 to 360 to learn, fail, relearn and succeed.
* Qualifying for this level 2x's the base salary with the incremental payout being in liquid tokenized stocks.
* A junior partner would focus on strategy for the quarter ahead.
* A 10x win here is needed to graduate.

#### Level 4: Senior Partner \| Day 720

Are you able to lead and be responsible for \(i.e. own\) a business?

* You are responsible for the success of a business. You have time from day 360 to 720 to learn, fail, relearn and succeed.
* You are the conscious keeper of the organisation.
* Qualifying for this level 2x's the base salary again with the incremental payout being in liquid tokenized stocks.
* A senior partner would focus on strategy 4 quarters ahead.
