# Basics of Ascending

### Affordance, not Entitlement.

Every individual's progress here occurs when \(because\) they have grown so much that it becomes stupid to not give them more responsibility. And for no other reason.

Focus all your energies on improving your output. Don't bother with signaling effort. Trust the system



### Ascend Paths

There are 2 journeys that you can take:

1. Problem Solver path
2. Problem See-er Path

#### 

|  | **Name** | **Competence** | **Responsibility** | **Pools of knowledge** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| L1 | A-player | Autonomy | Activity |  |
| L2 |  | Maxima | Process | Six Sigma |
| L3 | Junior Partner | Global Maxima | Function | First-principles thinking |
| L4 | Senior Partner | Genius  | Business | &lt;Blank&gt; Self-Knowledge. |

### Ascend Levels

**Level 1: Autonomy \| Day 45**  
Are you able to extract peak performance from yourself?

**Level 2: Leadership \| Day 180**  
Are you able to extract peak performance from others?

Leadership is a state of mind. We value the state of mind, not the identity of a being a "leader".

* A leader would focus on maxing out team productivity. Including but not limited to guiding their team towards implementing the operating principles \("Operating at TVP"\) in their lives.
* The path from \(including\) this level onwards is non-trivial. It's fine, take your time. You have time from day 45 to 180 to learn, fail, relearn and succeed.
* Qualifying for this level 2x's the base salary.

#### Level 3: Junior Partner \| Day 360

Are you able to lead and be responsible for \(i.e. own\) a business unit?

* You are responsible for the business case and success, of a part of the business. You have time from day 180 to 360 to learn, fail, relearn and succeed.
* Qualifying for this level 2x's the base salary with the incremental payout being in liquid tokenized stocks.
* A junior partner would focus on strategy for the quarter ahead.
* A 10x win here is needed to graduate.

#### Level 4: Senior Partner \| Day 720

Are you able to lead and be responsible for \(i.e. own\) a business?

* You are responsible for the success of a business. You have time from day 360 to 720 to learn, fail, relearn and succeed.
* You are the conscious keeper of the organisation.
* Qualifying for this level 2x's the base salary again with the incremental payout being in liquid tokenized stocks.
* A senior partner would focus on strategy 4 quarters ahead.

#### How does Ascend Occur



Attempting for n+1 ascend level i.e. evolution is not the default. It is a choice. You may take it whenever you feel ready. 

1. You may do so by telling your junior partner, so that they can optimize for your learning curve and create space for whenever you’d need help. 
   1. In due course, you’d be able to notify this by adding a slack badge. \#jarvis
2. The ideal time to do so is during the start of the quarter and include it in your OKRs

Enabling backtrack

When evolution goals feels weighty, you are also free to let go and settle for n ascend level.
