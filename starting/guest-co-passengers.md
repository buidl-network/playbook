# Guest Co-passengers

We have documented our vantage over the years and structured it as a work path called 'Observing Value'. 

We invite everyone to use it. Access is:

1. **$9.99/month:** To incentivize sincerity on the seeker's part, and motivation on ours.
2. **Currently, invite-only:** Request access from anyone in our team, on twitter.

The invite also provides access to our community and the following themed slack channels: 

1. \#learning-
2. \#mastering-
3. \#pulse-
