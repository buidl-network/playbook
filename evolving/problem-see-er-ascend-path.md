### Drawing Contrast

Solver path is about building consciousness at the Individual level. That makes the bet that individual performance is variable.

See-er path avoids that bet. Instead, the view is of dots, their inter-connectivity, and the patterns that emerge to form a living system. The bet here is that a system's output can be influenced by impacting its structure.

The individual is no longer personally relevant.

This is a paradigm shift.

### 

### Responsibility

 You are responsible for growing system's output. This path will require building the ability to:

1. **Reduce randomness** Predictability is power. It's easier to summon energy when things go 'according to plan.'   Planning will never work. Instead, observe. Zoom out as much as you need, until predictable patterns emerge. Use this view to be leading. Eliminate all elements that increase randomness. 
2. **Build Resilience** A machine that requires constant tinkering to remain operational, is unusable. Building the ability to withstand external randomness will require vantage i.e. staying ahead of the universe's curve. And building its incentives within the system.  Resilience = Eliminating uncertainty. 
3. **Establish Control** What can be controlled, can be changed. What can be changed, can be scaled.
