# Basics of Ascending

We are what we value.   
What we value, we seek.   
  
What we seek, we learn.   
What we learn, we apply.   
  
What we apply, we do.   
What we do, we accomplish   
  
What we acomplish, is reality.



### Ascend Paths

2 paths: 

1. **Problem Solver \|** Delivering Value ****Competence associated is the ability to deliver value. ****This is the majority of the team. ****
2. **Problem See-er** \| Unlocking Value Competence associated is the ability to increase business scale.

Each with the following levels:

1. Level 1: Autonomy
2. Level 2: Mastery
3. Level 3: Purpose
4. Level 4: Genius

### T shape players

Every role on every path requires a [T shape player.](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/value-t-shaped-people-mitchell-platt)  
  
Both see-ers and solvers require specific \(and general\) knowledge of their domain. See-ers additionally also require knowledge of discovering, executing and delivering new value.  


The difference between the 2 paths lies in the view of certainty in their mind.   
  
See-er path embraces chaos and uncertainty. Solver path is more benign.  
  
See-er is always looking into darkness and discovering vision along the way.  
Solver fuels the machine.



### Layers of Ascend

_We are what we value.   
What we value, we seek._   
  
1. **Belief System**  
  
All change germinates from the belief system. 

We associate based on these shared values. That includes dissociating when it isn't shared anymore. We call them [A-player attributes](https://playbook.thevantageproject.com/starting/a-player) in the team.

We commit to equipping A-player with all that they need to succeed.  Through ceiling-less opportunities to entice audacity, dopamine incentives to drive motivation, and mental models to build ability.

The commitment is not of self-transformation. Discovering your alignment with these attributes is your path.

  


  
_What we seek, we learn.   
What we learn, we apply._   
  
**2. Mental Models**  
__Lens that our mind forms based on our beliefs.   
  


  
_What we apply, we do.   
What we do, we accomplish_   
  
**3. Competence**   
__State of mind applied with discipline.  
__

  
_What we acomplish, is reality._  
  
**4. Output**  
Reality check of competence.

This is what we use to trigger ascend. That makes every individual's growth permissionless, aim-able, and trustless.
