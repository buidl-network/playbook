# Weekend Syncup

#### **Change 10: Decentralized weekend syncup**

**Why this change**

**Currently we do a org-wide syncup. Even though it serves system owners value, it isn’t valuable for individuals at level 1 and 2. Its impact can be observed in the downward trend of mindspace invested.**  


**New weekend syncups**

1. **Project wise Every proposal that is in delivery, is a separate project. Every other process is under project-grants-acquisition.  Syncup will be within each of these teams.**  
2. **Use it for planning ahead and not retrospective logging. Logging will be primarily left up to daily logs. The new order of questions is:**
   1. **What do you plan to accomplish this coming week?**
   2. **Align yourself to your reality. Reality != Being conservative. Here is what you had set as the plan for this week.**
   3. **What did you accomplish this week.**
      1. **You may also add things that were not planned. Observe their existence to increase accuracy of looking ahead.**

  
**Use data from b and c to improve a.Any other thoughts on your mind that you’d like to share with the team.**

### **Weekend Syncup:** 

**This document helps to make the weekend syncups more efficient by reducing the time it takes for people to get up to speed with what people had accomplished in the previous week + what they plan to do for the next week.**   


**Recommendations:** 

1. **Under “What do you plan to achieve in the next week” section mention specific, measurable goals that are falsifiable \(yes I was able to achieve it/no I was not\)**
   1. **Refer** [**SMART goals for setting goals**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4IU-y9-J8Q&feature=youtu.be&t=19)**.** 
   2. **The scope of goals should be limited to the individual and hence no dependency. “What do YOU plan to achieve?”**
      1. **Eg of a goal that doesn’t work: Working on X with the help of Y.**  
2. **From 1, similarly under “Accomplishments in the past week” section mention specific achievements.**
   1. **Please keep it focused to work.** 
   2. **Please mention only progress, not effort.** 
      1. **You can choose to say the truth by mentioning no progress.**
