How to communicate ETA in logs 

Inside a day: use ETA's. 

1. We break a process like understanding sales script into smaller pieces of manageable work and give ETA's for it. This helps us track progress for both you and me by giving a progress metric.
2. ETA’s are specific in nature and always attached to an outcome
   1. Example: Completing research into Module X by 8 PM August 17.
3. ETA’s specifics: 
   1. During the ETA period: if you gain awareness on that you wouldn't be able to meet the ETA, update me about the next ETA that you think you would be able to complete work by. Ensure that the team always knows when you would be finishing a particular task by.  
   2. Missed ETA: update me the next ETA.  
   3. Finished ETA: update me that you are finished with the ETA.  
   4. We don’t penalize on missing ETA’s, but not communicating and ghosting the team is looked down upon.   

  
  
What this process does is let us get the awareness of how much time it would actually need to do a particular task. Usually, humans are vulnerable to Planning Fallacy \([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning\_fallacy](https://slack-redir.net/link?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FPlanning_fallacy)\) because of their own ego.
