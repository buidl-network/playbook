# ETA Culture

\#What to do. Get straight to the point.   
  
What is the ETA culture?  


ETA = A time in the future when you see the success event occurring.  
Literally, it translates to estimated time to arrival.   
  


ETA is not a deadline. 

The goal is not to change the reality, it is to observe it, and then get accurate at it.

Let reality, not deadline decide when success occurs.   


Deadlines are at best, human decided limits. They are to be derided existence. 

We value vantage i.e. the ability to accurately see ahead.   


Use the phrase “What is its ETA that you see at the moment” to trigger this thought process from yourself and individuals in your team.

Remember, Running 90m is not the same as finishing 100m  


  
What is the importance of ETAs for your ascend path here. 

People tend to trust predictability. If your outcomes are predictable, you are likely to be entrusted with more opportunities than someone who is volatile.  
  
  
  


What is the importance of ETAs for your self-growth.

It is an indicator for your self to measure your alignment with integrity. It’s an abstraction to make the process easier. For, awareness in execution is a tough achievement

  
How to use the ETA indicator.

Watch it’s trend, not individual events.  
  
If you are regularly: 

1. Finishing tasks before ETA
   1. You are letting fear drive your work. Or just being lazy
      1. Someone more efficient is going to replace you
2. Finishing tasks after ETA
   1. You are being delusional
      1. Remember, you can let go of the compulsiveness to signal competence here. Instead, focus on actually building one.
3. On ETA
   1. You are in sync with reality. 
      1. Welcome aboard the rocketship.

Will I be judged basis ETA?

No. 

1. All decisions will be basis outcomes, not efforts. Competition is with the market and the other candidates in the pool.
2. You are competing against everyone who doesn't have the baggage and inefficiency of delusion/fear and they will be right \(true\) before you. 
   1. That’s the incentive to be better.

Do you have any tips to improve?

Include Vipassana meditation in your schedule.  
Vipassana is an exercise in integrity using the body’s sensations as a feedback tool. The same can be applied to your work and let your ETA trend serve as the feedback tool.  
  
Let go of your aversions and craving, hopes and delusions. Approach every ask, action and decision with equanimity i.e. be an aware witness.  
Live it.
