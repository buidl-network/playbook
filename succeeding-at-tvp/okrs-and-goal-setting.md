# OKRs and Goal Setting

## Objective and Key Results \(OKR\)

Objective

1. Statements that inspire and set direction. “Where do I want to go?”
2. Publically visible and shared.
3. This is subjective in nature.
4. Ideally 1 per team/individual.

  
Key Result

1. Milestones that measure progress towards the objective. “How do I know I am getting there?”
2. Publically visible and shared.
3. These are objective in nature. Refer to [SMART goal framework](https://youtu.be/U4IU-y9-J8Q?t=19)
4. Ideally 3-5 per team/individual.

Activities

1. Work required to deliver key results.
2. Not shared publically. This is a conversation for yourself.

OKRs as the foundational layer of our organisation. For, a company is merely a group of people on a common mission. That requires:  


Radical transparency

“What is happening in what part of the company.”  


Clarity of goals

“Where are we headed and how far am I from it.”  
  
Autonomy  
“How do I know what is the right decision to make”.

That requires a culture where decision making is principle-based and hence, consistently replicable at every individual’s end. It’s the possible assurance of consistency that may inspire the self-confidence needed to attempt it.  


Accountability

“How do I know my performance”  
All self-review \(and review\) need to be objective, self-administrable and real time.   
  
  
  


The presence of OKRs is the foundation that enables them.
