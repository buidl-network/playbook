# Feedback System

#### Change 2: Introducing Feedback Loops

Why this change

Only outcomes matter in the universe and hence, to the organization. 

However, outcomes are a lagging indicator. By the time failure occurs, it’s game over.   


State of mind is a leading indicator. There has been significant mindspace spent on mapping attributes &lt;&gt; success. We truly believe that if the attributes for each level exist, success for that level is inevitable. 

This principle is our tenant and it’s current mapping, our hypothesis. The latter is an experiment in motion and will improve over time.  
  


Similarly from the individual’s lens. Confirmation of progress should not have to depend on:  


1. Having to judge your performance from your boss’s mood This is the underlying principle behind objective scoring based feedback systems that are not limited to 1:1s. List given below.  
2. Failure at battles It is certain that failures will occur, they are only a problem if they break a man’s spirit. World is a random function and hence, moments of failure are a certainty.  Let your merit not be decided by things that are not in your control, but the ones that are. 

Here are the loops being introduced:  


1. Monthly 1:1 Space Read the new format for 1:1s further below.  
2. “Help me improve” on Daily logs routine Whenever the individual senses that motion \(not progress\) is starting to rear its head, you can ask for a review. You may also add what you are sensing is occurring.  Your team lead \(if doesn’t exist, then junior partner\) will be available to help observe and course correct.  This will be implemented through Jarvis soon. Until then, it is done manually through DM.  
3. ETA analytics ETAs are useless if they are not trackable and their trend, not observable.  We will implement a feature of all your currently communicated ETAs and a post-analysis of their accuracy. This will be executed through Jarvis soon.   

Default purpose of all loops is limited to self-consumption. Hence, they may occur only at the individual’s desire, not by force. Cyclical events will be scheduled by default. The individual may choose to mark them as not needed. 

At the moment, this will be done by marking the respective gcal event as ‘not attending’. In due course, this would be through Jarvis. 





1. 1. What can I do to make it more efficient to work with me? 
   2. What could I do or stop doing that would make your lives better?

  
What to ask.

Whenever life feels comfortable and you are motivated to change it.

When should you ask for it.

Reach out to your team on slack. Tell them what you need their help in being better.  
Make a copy of this form to solicit feedback: [Help me be better](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeb7Pa9zVG2I3xylXrgQrrEYiZbr0GSlumly6KROPrkNErSAA/viewform)  
  
It is also recommended that you add it to your profile on slack. \(Find “edit my profile” &gt; “what I do”\)  
  
  


1. Scheduled 1:1 reviews With your team leader and organized around your current status on each of the [5 autonomy attributes.  ](https://www.thevantageproject.com/playbook/#aplayer)Schedule them for yourself \(and send a calendar invite to your team leader\) on:
   1. Day 0, Day 15 and 45.
   2. Every month from then on.  
2. Spontaneous feedback

There are 2 types of feedback tools we use:
