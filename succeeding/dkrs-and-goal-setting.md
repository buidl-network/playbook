# DKRs and Goal Setting

### Desires

What would you like to achieve this month. Let your ambition write and self-observation edit.  
This is a statement of intent and subjective.

### Key results

What outcomes will need to occur for that output to not be untrue? This is that checklist.  
Use [SMART](https://youtu.be/U4IU-y9-J8Q?t=19) framework here.  


### Example DKR for level 2:

**Desire:** Mine all revenue opportunities within X from this cycle

**Key Results:**

1. 5 opportunities validated by 7th.
2. 3 proposals submitted by 14th.
3. 100k worth of proposals accepted by 30th.

### 

### Writing DKRs

Desires get refreshed at the following frequency:

1. Level 1 and 2: Monthly
2. Level 3: Quarterly
3. Level 4: Annually

Key Results are refreshed every month.

This activity is done collaboratively with your team and on one the first Saturday of every month.
