# Feedback Loops

Only outcomes matter. Yet, outcomes are a lagging indicator.   
Self-Observation is a leading indicator. Sometimes, that may require external help.  


Here are the loops we follow:

1. \*\*\*\*[**Monthly 1:1 Status Check**](https://playbook.thevantageproject.com/succeeding/feedback-loops/monthly-status-check) A 1:1 observational conversation with your leader. 
2. **“Help me improve” on Daily Logs** Invite your junior partner to help observe your schedule and help distinguish motion from progress. 
3. **ETA analytics** ETAs are a powerful tool if the trend of their accuracy can be observed. _Coming soon_  

Default purpose of all loops is self-consumption. Hence, they may occur only at the individual’s desire, not by force. 

Cyclical events will be scheduled by default. The individual may choose to mark them as not needed.
