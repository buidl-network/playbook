# Feedback Loops

Only outcomes matter. Yet, outcomes are a lagging indicator.   
Self-Observation is a leading indicator. Sometimes, that may require external help.  


Here are the loops we follow:

1. **Monthly 1:1 Status Check** Read the new format for 1:1s further below. 
2. **“Help me improve” on Daily Logs** Invite your junior partner to help observe your schedule and see motion from progress. 
3. **ETA analytics** ETAs are a powerful tool if the trend of their accuracy can be observed. _Coming soon_  

Default purpose of all loops is self-consumption. Hence, they may occur only at the individual’s desire, not by force. 

Cyclical events will be scheduled by default. The individual may choose to mark them as not needed.
