# Monthly Status Check

This is an opportunity to unlock growth using the instrument of truth, executed through a 1:1 observational conversation with your leader.

The conversation is anchored around the individual's current progress vis-Ã -vis their current ascend attributes.

During the first 45 days, there are 3 additional status checks on day 7, 21, and 45.

Sometimes, switching from FPP \(first-person perspective\) to TPP \(third-person perspective\) is easier through leveraging a real third person.   
  
This is space as a detached mirror.   
You may also choose to skip it.

### Process

1. **Self-scoring by the Individual.** Including their state of mind behind the score.
2. **Junior Partner offers their lens.** Includes data, scores, and their state of mind behind them.
3. **Facetime** For threads that are more efficiently closed in a verbal conversation.

### Privacy

By default, all status checks are private. They can be made public by the individual, at their volition.
