# Executing at TVP

## Executing at TVP

The vantage you will need to successfully execute here.

> Understanding the problem completely, is the solution itself.

#### Outcomes are occurrences, that occur as a result of a process.

Think of it as a production line that manufactures cars \(for visual\). The output is a completely built car with an assembly line assembling different parts.

Once the car is done, its characteristics and hence, scope isn’t in your control. The only place where you’d be able to impact change is in the process before it.

This POV is similar to systems thinking. The latter helps in analysis and helps arrive at "why", the former is forward looking and helps arrive at "how to".

**Vantage:** Whenever trying to understand how an outcome will be achieved, focus on seeing the process behind its current state \(if it’s an optimization strategy\) or seeing the process behind a similar or correlated outcome \(if it’s an innovation strategy\). In that vantage, you should be able to see the variables of the process and hence, its lever. You are now in control.

#### What you don’t measure, can’t get improved.

Use:

1. Macro level data for:
   * Post-battle analysis
   * Successive goal setting
2. Micro level data for finding oppurtunities for improvement.  Think of it like your personal ultrasound lens.

#### \(Micro level\) Data tells. Listen to it and it will also tell you the path to your victory.

1. What kind of data to look for: Ratios.

Absolute numbers are a manager’s vanity, not a doers tool.

2. All processes occur in stages.

A car production assembly is usually not one single line. It is divided between multiple sections like paintshop, body works, engine assembly etc.

For simplification, assume this to be a straight line process where all sections work in series and none in parallel and hence, directly dependend on each other.

**Vantage:**Hence, identifying its stages can offer you control. What you can control, you can change.

How to know which events are user progress-ion and which are user motion?

Every event that lies on the path towards creating revenue from the user is progress-ion. For every other vector isn’t progress.

How to find opportunities for growth once the funnel is ready?

This is a skill that will build with time.

#### Critical path is the shortest path

In the car assembly line, the maximum rate of production is = the lowest common rate of the all components. ONLY the lowest common rate.

Hence, the input car part that is the slowest \(most lagging\) is what the final assembly out is going to be. All focus must always be to increase rate of production only that step.

In chemistry there exists a similar concept: Rate determining step.

**Vantage:** Always focus on improving the rate determining step. Only. Until it isn’t one anymore. Then move the one that is the new rate determining step.

#### Innovation isn’t a project, it is an experiment.

If you can’t see at least a path to the outcome, it is still an innovation problem. Projects don’t solve innovation problems. Experiments do. Experiments are designed to test the limits of failure, projects are designed to not fail.

**Vantage:** Convert each innovation “project” into an operational one by doing enough experiments to gain vantage on how to reach the outcome.

For that ensures once a project is underway in the company, its victory is certain.
