         1. Will take practice
2. Structure your ask to be:
   1. Complete When you write; before you send it; validate that the receiver will have all the inputs that they need to deliver the output that you need from them.  Does your ask have an explicit ask?
   2. Concise ![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/Kze-R7uZ0PULKHDS2Y89TA4mfLBRvbjoxeZXdqJXeh0LAlz2Bw5sols-pbJQNH6YzgkNlVOA1Wu3hg7ryJOIptkWxR_nn-3B_xiH8g1IjNpMs9X4b1dJEGDUKmpTkgxbVK2MyIjO)   
   3. Easy to respond: Reduce cognitive overload
      1. Easiest questions are the ones that can be responded to in Yes and no.

4. Check for appropriateness of your response before you send/speak
   1. Will they now have whatever it is that they were looking for from you?
      1. Don’t offer what you want without having offered what they want first.

1. Think before you speak
2. Usually text would be more efficient than voice
   1. Even though it looks more difficult
3. Lists are easier to read. Prefer them.
