# Silent Meetings



A company is a group of individuals aligned to a common goal. More often than not you’ll need to collaborate with other people.  
  


Meetings are the shittest way to do it. Expensive, disruptive and painful.   


1. 1. Expensive: For a team, even a one-hour, once in 2 days meeting of 5 people costs 30k just in time costs. If this cost was to be for a tool they had to buy, it will be a decision with considerable deliberation; yet such cost is spent on meeting at a whim.
   2. Disruptive: Time cost is trivial in the face of the disruption it causes to people’s schedule and flow. The impact of that on productivity and hence, cost is a healthy multiple.
   3. Painful: Who gets excited by the thought of a meeting?

Here is how we collaborate without needing a manager driven culture.  


Silent Meetings

A typical meeting is someone speaking and everyone listening. A colossal waste of cumulative time, and drain of human motivation.  


Silent meetings are inverted. Focussed on Listening \(reading\) instead of battling for face time.  


How to do a Silent Meeting?

1. Every meeting is a pull event in nature
   1. Pulled by someone/team that wants a discussion on something
      1. That person is the owner that leads the meeting.
2. A meeting doc is created i.e. everything that the owner wants others to know for the meeting.
   1. Agenda
   2. Current Status
   3. Asks
   4. Actions
      1. To be filled later
   5. Sample template \(most need not be this tightly structured\): [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-NLvzg5iYIoXjnRxfvh\_HnZYbENg1wSC0U2RmuZTyr4/edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-NLvzg5iYIoXjnRxfvh_HnZYbENg1wSC0U2RmuZTyr4/edit)
3. Once you have the meeting doc, you’ve convened the meeting. 
   1. Then everyone reads and comments \(including questions\) on the doc.
   2. Once you are done with the first pass of the document, go back to the beginning and do a second pass. You are encouraged to respond to other’s comments where needed.
      1. Keep all comments unresolved. They may be useful for others.
         1. Only the meeting owner may resolve them.
   3. Once common threads of discussions emerge, discussion time can begin.
      1. Meeting owner decides.
4. For smaller groups or one to ones, the first 2 steps can be async and step 3 can be on-demand. For the rest, it occurs on a scheduled time and on location.

Why Silent meeting?

Apart from the exponentially higher productivity:

1. Old school meetings tend to incentive the loudest voice
   1. Yet, in reality, only the most accurate voice is consequential.
2. Silent meetings prioritize thinking over saying
3. The goal is to get things done, not heroism.

When not to use a Silent Meeting?

1. When the agenda is to discuss emotion
   1. For eg. an issue you are facing at work
2. When the agenda is to share success/inspire
   1. Prefer to announce it on slack or in between breaks.
