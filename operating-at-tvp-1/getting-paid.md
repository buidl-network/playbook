# Getting Paid

**Getting Paid**

All staff payments are made by the 5th of the month. We also follow another payment cycle around the 20th of the month, for vendor payments.

**Reimbursements**

We follow a no-bureaucracy policy. And instead have focused on fostering meritocracy i.e. correlating higher productivity to a higher payout for you. And hence, everything that increases your productivity funds its self. Buy for yourself, whatever makes you better.

Any non-personal spend can be suggested on the \#office channel on slack.
