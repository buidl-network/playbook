# Work Schedule

We work 24x7. 

Unblocking time.





**Your life is your week. Your week is your day. Your day is this moment. Fix it.**  
  


**Optimize your schedule for:**

1. **Affordance: Only schedule what you can afford to follow. Start with the bare minimum and increase the quantum as you go along, until you find the sweet balance between schedule being a constraint vs it being liberating \(from logistical thinking\).**
2. **White space:  For context read** [**Whitespace in Design**](https://medium.com/successivetech/importance-of-whitespace-in-good-design-de03ea0ab4db)**. It is the white space that creates the importance of content. Content in itself is mere chaos. Create whitespaces in your life. Ideally 20% of each day.**
3. **Flow state: Aim for peak performance as much as possible. When it isn’t happening, consider taking a break and regaining productivity.**
4. **Coordination: Account for time for others. Especially if you are attempting level 2+ \(leadership\). Recommended method is to open up a slot on your work calendar for others to book.** [**Example**](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/selfsched?sstoken=UUpJTnVfcVlSNmR5fGRlZmF1bHR8ZTIzOGI1YWVjNTUzZGE4OGE3ODg0YWMwNDcxN2ZlOTc)**.** 

**What are our work timings?**

**You’d find that to be an alien nomenclature here. A desire to control \(your work schedule\), is dissonant with our desire to increase human freedom.**  
  


**Here is a popular schedule that exists:  
Ideal day**

1. **9 to 12am: Morning Deepwork Sprint**
2. **1pm: Travel to office + sync up**
3. **2 to 6pm: Evening sprint. Can involve meetings.**
4. **6pm: Unwinding. Grab a beer, take a stroll or hit the gym or anything that works for you.** 
   1. **We recommend that you not underestimate the importance of acclimatizing out of the flow state.**

**Ideal week**

**2 regular days of working together in office:**

1. **Monday: 11 am to 6pm**
   1. **10 am Vipassana**
2. **Saturday: 10am to 6pm**
3. **Rest of the days are remote work.**

  
**Teams can plan their week ahead every Monday when they meet. And schedule more time at their volition.**  
  


**Ideas to design your day**

1. **Divide the day into 2 half-day sprints**
2. **Let people know when you are plugged in and hence, when not to disturb you.**
   1. **Wearing earphones/headphones is a good method.**
3. **If you need someone’s mind space immediately and they are plugged in, ping them on slack.**
   1. **Let them respond to you at their volition. Don’t assume you have access to their mindspace just because they are physically accessible.** 
   2. **If it’s urgent, mention that when you ping them. At most.**
      1. **And move onto the next action on your plate.**
      2. **Be respectful. Don’t bug. Even if the sky is falling. Learn to handle your shit.**

**Taking time off**

**We don't want to tell you how to manage your time, we trust you to do your best to maximize your productivity. Also, we'll let the guy who is trying to replace you, do so. :\)**  
  


**You take less time off, there is a risk of burning burn out. You become lazy, and you can be beaten.**   


**Productivity is a skill that takes discipline, trial and initiative.**  
  
  


**Communicating time off**

**Communicate broadly when you will be away so other people can manage time efficiently, projects don't slip through the cracks, and so that you don't get bothered while away.**

**The general rule of thumb is:**  


**Number of days you’ll be away = number of days of advance notice to give to your team.**
