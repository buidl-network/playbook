# Hello World

## Welcome to the TVP Playbook

We celebrate human potential. We place disproportionate value on an individual's desire for achievement and for his work to be his highest expression.   
This translates into an environment of A-players, working together towards creating a better world for ourselves. 

Frictionless cooperation between free humans is a complex coordination problem. Playbook is where we document our attempt at a solution, by defining the protocols of work.

### Evolution

> “Freedom and nature, Smith concludes, are a surer guide to the creation of a harmonious, functioning society than the supposed reason of philosophers and visionaries.” -Adam Smith

This is our guiding principle. We strive towards the natural order of human behavior. And like evolution, we are an experiment in-progress.
