We place disproportionate value on an individual's desire for achievement and for his work to be his highest expression. We are a celebration of human potential. 

This translates into an environment that fosters A-players, working together towards creating a better world for ourselves.

### Guiding Principle: Evolution

> “Freedom and nature, Smith concludes, are a surer guide to the creation of a harmonious, functioning society than the supposed reason of philosophers and visionaries.” -Adam Smith

We strive towards the natural order of human behavior i.e. evolution. Whenever in doubt, focus on rewarding success. And like evolution, we are an experiment in-progress.
