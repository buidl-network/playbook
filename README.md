# Hello World

## Welcome to the TVP Playbook

We place disproportionate value on human potential. We see ourselves as a sports team \(think football\) i.e. built to win. We spend significant effort to scout, develop and cut to ensure champions in every position. All our teams are under 11 players, aligned to victory \(not survival\) and relentlessly focussed on promoting A-player potential.

Playbook is the framework that enables it.

Current version: 1.1 \| [change log](https://github.com/thevantageproject/web/commits/gh-pages/playbook/index.html)

### Guiding principle: Evolution

> “Freedom and nature, Smith concludes, are a surer guide to the creation of a harmonious, functioning society than the supposed reason of philosophers and visionaries.” -Adam Smith

We strive towards the natural method of human behaviour. \#reality

And like evolution, we are an experiment in-progress.

First principles of our culture:

#### Trust

**Consistency:** Unpredictability can not be trusted and only fuels doubt. We strive towards a principle based decision making. Playbook is an attempt in that direction.

**Reciprocity:** If performance and reward do not share a direct correlation and/or need a subjective opinion based evaluation, then it isn’t performance that is served.

#### Care

We value ourselves enough to care where and how we spend our time. We look for people that have an insatiable appetite for self-growth and are not okay with existing.

We will always only take limited period bets on people and every moment from that point on will only be to help the individual succeed.

#### Growth

Motion is not progress. Progress is non-trivial.

Our primary intent is to enable an environment condusive to personal growth. You will find traces of this state of mind, all over the playbook.

#### Impact

We perform better when we feel a part of something bigger than ourselves. We seek to offer that feeling to everybody.

### How to update playbook

Make a PR on the [gh-pages branch](https://github.com/thevantageproject/web/blob/gh-pages/playbook/index.html) proposing the change and the pricinple behind it. A discussion will follow. If and when a consensus is reached, it will be merged.

We envisage this structure to be ever-evolving and would encourage you to contribute with your vantage.
