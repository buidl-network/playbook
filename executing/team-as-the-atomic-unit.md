# Team as the atomic unit

## 

Team is a group of individuals working together to produce a complete output.

Team is the basic unit of the organisation. The individual is useless in isolation. We can’t even beat a trivial strain on our own. It is only our cooperation that has ensured sapien’s rise to the top of the foodchain.

This is goint to be a shift of paradigm from the path until now.

Currently, grants acquisition is a team. Each project in execution has a team. Each new experiment will have a team.  
Each project and process is a team.  
Project is a Process that is one time.

The look of teams will constantly be changing to business outcomes.

Individuals are organized around processes, not the other way around.
