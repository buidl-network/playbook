### Wealth Games

Wealth is ownership of assets that others seek and hence, 'value'. Competence, State of mind, and Energy are self-accessible and universally available assets.   
  
Money is only a denomination \(of wealth\) and useless by itself. 

1. Its **purpose** comes from what it can get done. That is, transform itself into.
2. Its **existence** comes from value creation.

  
Money is a consequence. Value is the appropriate target. 

The simple way to increase value is to be useful.

### Unlocking Value

Success requires coordinated competence across multiple stakeholders, translated into output. 

Value is created by positively impacting output. 

There are 3 ways to increase output:

1. **Free up \(higher value\) throughput** Take responsibility of a part of the system that is currently the responsibility of an L3+ individual. Thus, freeing their mind and affording the system access to their additional throughput.  Responsibility is earned through demonstrated competence of the same outcome.   ****This is popular at L1 and L2 and unlocks linear gains. 
2. **Increase throughput** Transform the system \(not individuals\) into a higher throughput state using \(system and incentive\) design. Efficacy of a coordination network is a perpetual problem.  Helpful watch: [Mechanism Design 101 \| Sam Williams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCFlGLbI_kE)  ****This is popular at L3 and unlocks quadratic gains.  ****
3. **Discover throughput** Be able to see, new pots of gold and their execution into output.   This is popular at L4 and unlocks exponential gains.

### Measuring Value

Attributing specific value to individual output in any multi-stakeholder system where 1+1=11, is a non-trivial problem. Yet, inconsequential.   
The real problem is individuals lacking visibility of how \(and which of\) their actions translate into output. And hence, are valuable. 

[Ascend Framework](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18VyIU74VTjJ9m1lkchmo_aAn5KN3GkpSpjbOH_QiZGM/edit?via_commande=true#gid=882172859) is the model we use for this problem. With an easy mapping of business output to [individual competence benchmarks](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18VyIU74VTjJ9m1lkchmo_aAn5KN3GkpSpjbOH_QiZGM/edit?via_commande=true#gid=461665169), denominated in actual $ value.  
  
The system has been designed to be simple enough that:

1. Anyone at any time is able to self-measure the value of their current output. 
2. Exactly know the distance to their next ascend. 

Ascend occurs in run-time.



### Setting goals is not a strategy

Ascend level-based outputs exist to help self-measure and hence, afford [agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agency_%28philosophy%29). Nothing more. Do not confuse a goal with strategy. 

Building relevant competence may be a strategy.

### Todo for your mind

In a world filled with violence and its consequent victimhood, accruing value without taking from others \(including the system\) is a non-obvious idea.  

It will take non-trivial effort to truly see. Do consider [Understanding Truth](https://playbook.thevantageproject.com/foundation/understanding-truth) and [Limits of Engagement](https://playbook.thevantageproject.com/foundation/limits-of-engagement) sections again.
