# Output as a Process

## Output is an occurrence, that occurs as a result of a set of activities.

Think of a production line that manufactures cars \(for visual\). The output is a completely built car with an assembly line assembling different parts.

Once the car is done, its characteristics and hence, scope isn’t in your control. The only place where you’d be able to impact change is in the process before it.

Focus on impacting the activities that create the output. This is the only place where output is influence-able. Output by itself is not.
