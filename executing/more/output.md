Being a leader/being on time/finishing the specs are not the ask in the system.  Creating Value is.   
  
These are all merely run-time occurrences.   
Run-time; for, their virtue is limited to the time output is generated.   
It leads to the output, but it is not output. 

Optimizing and Setting goals towards it creates local maxima, releases some dopamine, and feeds the pride of accomplishment. And not much more.
