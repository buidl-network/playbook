# Asking the Right Question

Before making up your mind:  
  
Think about what the problem is   
Instead of the virtues of the solution on your mind. 



Much of the mind is already made up. Mostly occupied by past stored data, whose appropriateness wasn't addressed at the time of writing to disk. 



Be Curious. Not skeptical.





Do not ask why should it be done.  
Ask what should be done.   
  
Existence of that 'what', is integrity.
