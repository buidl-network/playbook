# Understanding Value

### Wealth Games

Wealth is ownership of assets that others seek and hence, 'value'. Competence, State of mind, and Energy are the universal assets.   
  
Money is only a denomination of wealth. It can not be the agenda.   
Money by itself is useless. Its value comes from what it can do aka 'value'.   
Money is a consequence. Value is the agenda.  
  
The way to increase wealth \(and as a consequence, bank balance\) is to be useful.   
  
Help others unlock higher wealth   
By solving problems that are limiting them  
Hence, providing value and earning $ in return.

### Unlocking Value

Success requires coordinated competence across multiple stakeholders, translated into output. This is a limitless problem.

The ability to transform the system into a higher throughput state is what unlocks value.  
This starts by maximizing your individual throughput, and then spreading your competence to a larger surface area.

There are 3 ways to unlock value:

1. **Free up \(higher value\) throughput** This occurs at L1 and L2. It unlocks linear gains. 
2. **Increase throughput** This occurs at L3. It unlocks exponential gains.  ****
3. **Discover throughput** This occurs at L4. It unlocks limitless gains.

### Mapping Value

Attributing specific value to individual output in multi-stakeholder teams where 1+1=11, is a non-trivial problem.

We solve this through the [Ascend Framework](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18VyIU74VTjJ9m1lkchmo_aAn5KN3GkpSpjbOH_QiZGM/edit?via_commande=true#gid=882172859) with a rough mapping of business output to [individual rewards](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18VyIU74VTjJ9m1lkchmo_aAn5KN3GkpSpjbOH_QiZGM/edit?via_commande=true#gid=461665169), at each scope of competence. 

The system has been designed to be simple enough, that anyone at anytime can calculate their current $ output \(basis the framework\) and always know their performance. Be in control, always. 

At any given point of time, you are working towards increasing competence. When the threshold for ascend occurs, you progress. 

### Setting a goal is not a strategy

Setting a $ value as your pole star will only lead to frustration. 

The system has very emphatheically mapped competence with ascend. Focus on building the competence. Let ascend trigger itself.

### System's Ask 

Expectation here is not to be a good leader/&lt;insert any other responsibility&gt;  
These are **Run time outcome != output**

The system expects you to focus on maximizing value for yourself, with integrity. That is, align yourself to your bank balance. Wealth is a source of freedom, not guilt; Irrespective of what the society wants you to believe.





Expectation here is not to be a good leader/&lt;insert any other responsibility&gt;  
These are **Run time outcome != output**

There will always be 1 output at BUIDL value \(in $ terms\).

We have created a system to do so. 



Creating value without taking from others \(including the system\) is a non-obvious idea.   
Do consider Understanding Truth and Limits of Engagement sections again.   
In a world of violence and its victimhood, this will take hard effort to truly see.  
   
Our ask from you would be to focus on. Stay aligned to your bank balance, without violating limits that you consent to.

This is also why ascend levels only consider value generated as qualifications.
