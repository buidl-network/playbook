## Lead



The popular idea of ‘Leadership’ centered around a heroic ‘leader’ is to be avoided.

The lens to use is the idea of ‘Leading Indicators’ in different fields.

Here is a simple list from google search for leading indicators. Use them to get a feel of the idea. The content of the posts is inconsequential.

Leadership is about becoming the ‘leading indicator’ and using that influence to impact change. Nothing more.  
Leadership is a status game. Leading is a wealth game.

You have to be today, where the system is going to be tomorrow.
