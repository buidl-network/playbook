# Seeing the Real 'Why'

Understanding the cause of an occurrence is a non-apparent skill. We are trained to see only as far as what garners social acceptance. 



|  |  |  |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
|  |  | 'Why was the product delivered late?' |
| **Status** | What occurred | 'I missed my timelines' |
| **Behavior** | What enabled it | 'I put in less than 4 hours per day' |
| **Belief** | What caused it | 'Delay of a day or two is acceptable' |



Status is always the most obvious answer. And the most untrue.

Understand the why Keep asking the why until you reach an answer that you can change in yourself.

### Role of Values

Our mind makes decisions based on the value system it is subscribed to. Most of it is learned through social institutionalization; not discovered within.

Belief is emotion. Value is intellect. They are interchangeable in their purpose here. Use whatever is your usual method.

When you discover the belief that is hindering progress. Evaluate if it really is relevant, to this moment. That self-question, executed with integrity is enough for transformation.

There are no objective beliefs, only subjective truths.
